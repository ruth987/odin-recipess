        Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the 
        type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with 
        several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such 
        as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.

        The Italian favorite of lasagne or lasagna that we all know and love
        originated in Italy in the city of Naples during the Middle Ages. One 
        of the first references to modern-day lasagne can be found in a 14th-century 
        English cookbook that highlighted a dish with layers of pasta without the 
        tomatoes.
