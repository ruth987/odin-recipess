    <h1>BURGER</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        Burger is a dish consisting of a flat round cake of minced beef,<br>
        or sometimes another savoury ingredient, that is fried or grilled<br>
        and served in a split bun or roll with various condiments and <br>
        toppings.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Wisconsin, many claim the burger was invented by Charlie Nagreen,<br>
        who purportedly sold a meatball between two slices of bread at an <br>
        1885 fair in Seymour. In Athens, Tex., the title of “hamburger creator” <br>
        is bestowed upon Fletcher Davis, who supposedly came up with it in the <br>
        1880s.

    <h3>How to Make Basic Beef Burger</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. <br>
            Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands<br>
            or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick <br>
            patties.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 <br>
            minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read <br>
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least <br>
            160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</p></li>
