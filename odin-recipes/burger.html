        Burger is a dish consisting of a flat round cake of minced beef,
        or sometimes another savoury ingredient, that is fried or grilled
        and served in a split bun or roll with various condiments and 
        toppings.

        In Wisconsin, many claim the burger was invented by Charlie Nagreen,
        who purportedly sold a meatball between two slices of bread at an 
        1885 fair in Seymour. In Athens, Tex., the title of “hamburger creator” 
        is bestowed upon Fletcher Davis, who supposedly came up with it in the 
        1880s.

    <h3>How to Make Basic Beef Burger</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. 
            Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands
            or a fork until well blended. Form into four 3/4-inch-thick 
            patties.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 
            minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
            160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</p></li>
